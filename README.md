#The Echoes of Rememberance

My Text RPG Project, The Echoes of Rememberance, is a game which tackles issues of trust, and allows for combat in an Undertale like style.



#Installation

If you wish to run this game yourself, download the exe and cpp files, and then run the exe file and enjoy



#Playing Through

This game includes a lot of stutter text, so if you wish to fast forward the text press '1' to skip. Any key works fine as well but when the program takes input it runs better with '1'.



#Collaboration

This game was created as a school project, so it is not as good as a traditional RPG and can be quite boring. If you wish to collaborate that would be greatly appreciated! 
Just fork the repository and make changes as you'd like, and please give credit to me when using my work.
